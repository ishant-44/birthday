       Happy Birthday, my Dumbo ❤️

Today you turn 18, and somehow it feels unreal — like time decided to run faster just to bring you to this moment. Watching you grow, smile, dream, and become you has been one of the most beautiful things in my life.

Dumbo, you don’t even realize how special you are. The way you laugh, the way you care, the way you exist — it all makes my world softer and brighter. Even on ordinary days, you somehow manage to make everything feel warmer just by being there.

Mayu , today isn’t just about another year added to your life — it’s about celebrating 18 years of a heart that deserves all the love in the world. I hope this year gives you happiness that feels calm, love that feels safe, and dreams that slowly start coming true.

No matter where life takes us, I want you to always remember this:
there is someone who believes in you, cares for you deeply, and is endlessly grateful that you were born.

Happy Birthday, my Dumbo 🐘💗
Stay the beautiful soul you are.

— Yours, always ❤️
